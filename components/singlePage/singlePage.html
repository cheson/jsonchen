        Hello!
        I was looking around for inspiration about a good about me design, and EVERYONE has nice portraits.
        I like nice portraits, but if we become friends, which I hope we do (check out coffee with jason!),
        you'll find that I also like
        doing things that a different from the rest. So I've decided that I'm going to give my best shot at
        drawing myself, and every once in a while I'll keep updating the drawing until one day you might be
        able to discern what I look like. INCLUDE THE VERSION NUMBER. (v 1.0)

        I'm your regular kid who's tried to make a website for the last -5- years, and every year I think I can
        do it and it always turns out like this: link to something

        I have a passion for computer science, making ideas into working things, and most of all people. I love languages
        and will never stop learning them. Sign language. Dream job be able to connect with helping immigration and
        help other people have what i have been able to have.

        I feel like a lot of those descriptions are like coffee or wine: "I am a web designer with bold streaks of
        dark chocolate and hints of citrus." Like you can't be those things.

    What? Yeah I know it's jibber jabber to me. If that's you too, let's break it down!

    From initial inspection it seems like JSON is some sort of notation to represent Javascript Objects.

    Javascript is just a programming language, which is really no different from Spanish or Japanese or Swahili or
    whatever else you speak, except the grammar and vocabulary are a bit more strictly enforced.

    Objects! These are exactly what you think they are. You can take anything you want to represent, give it a name,
    and we'll be able to make a JSON Object. For example: {Jason: Person} (attribute value pairs)

    There you are! Now you too are a JSON expert.

    You can make your great grandma's favorite pie recipe a json.
    {flour: 2 grams
    directions: [
    mix the flour,

    ]
    }

    give example of things stored in json format. weather data.
    user profiles, stock market transactions,

    human readable: none of that messy 1000101010101 stuff you see on tv.

    Okay, so you know what they are now, but what's the big deal?
    Lightweight, text format that makes sharing information really quick and easy. It's a notation everyone has agreed on (open standard format) and understands (human-readable text).

        I don't use too many of the social media so you won't find a link to my twitter or instagram.
        I don't want to rely on likes or notifications to feel like I have a purpose. I know I'm habitually
        addicted to the praise of others, and because of that I've deleted them to avoid being drawn into
        what I know is unhealthy for me. That said, you can email me at chesonIGNORETHISIFYOUHAVEAPULSE[at]stanford[dot]edu.
        We can also meet up and have coffee!!!

        linkedIn, coffeewithjason, medium,

        If you are a person looking for people who are looking for jobs, email me and I'll be happy to send you my resume.
